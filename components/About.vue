          Hello! I'm Michael, and I've been shaping the web for over 15 years.
          My journey in web development has been driven by a passion for
          creating beautiful, efficient, and user-friendly applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my career, I've specialized in Vue.js and modern frontend
          technologies. I'm particularly enthusiastic about combining Vue.js
          with Tailwind CSS to create stunning, responsive interfaces that
          provide exceptional user experiences.
        </p>
        <p>Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:</p>
        <ul class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2 font-mono text-sm">
          <li
            v-for="tech in technologies"
            :key="tech"
            class="flex items-center"
          >
            <span class="text-green mr-2">â–¹</span> {{ tech }}
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
